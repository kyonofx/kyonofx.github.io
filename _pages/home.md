<h1>ABOUT</h1>

I am a graduate student at MIT CSAIL working with
<a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/tommi.html">Tommi Jaakkola</a>
and <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://mir.g.harvard.edu/people/boris-kozinsky">Boris Kozinsky</a>. 
I am interested in creating machine learning capabilities for scientific discovery, with a focus on scalability and expressivity. 
My research aims to leverage the multi-scale and multi-modal nature of physical systems, as well as physical symmetries to develop powerful and efficient learning models and algorithms.
My research combines generative modeling of atomistic structures, and learned simulation to improve our understanding and accelerate the discovery of new materials and molecules.
