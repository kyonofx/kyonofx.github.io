<h1>ABOUT</h1>

I am a graduate student at MIT CSAIL working with
<a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/tommi.html">Tommi Jaakkola</a>
and <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://mir.g.harvard.edu/people/boris-kozinsky">Boris Kozinsky</a>. 
I am interested in advancing machine learning capabilities for scientific discovery, emphasizing both scalability and expressivity. 
My research aims to leverage the multi-scale and multi-modal nature of physical systems, as well as their symmetry properties, to develop powerful and efficient learning models and algorithms.
My research combines generative modeling of atomistic structures and learned simulation techniques, with the goal of accelerating the design of new materials and molecules with desired properties.
